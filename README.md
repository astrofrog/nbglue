### What is nbglue?

This is a hack/technology preview designed to explore how one might use [glue](http://www.glueviz.org) in the Jupyter notebook.

### How do I install it?

At the moment, you don't - **nbglue** is just a single-file module and since this is still just an experiment, I deliberately have not made it into a proper package.

### How do I try it out?

Start up the Jupyter notebook using ``jupyter notebook`` and take a look at the *Using glue in the notebook with nbglue* notebook.

### Why not use e.g. bokeh or Matplotlib's WebAgg instead of popping up Qt windows?

That's the plan, but for now this is just meant as a quick hack. If you are interested in helping build proper notebook viewers for glue, I'd love to hear from you!
